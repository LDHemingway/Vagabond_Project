## Vagabond

This app was developed with the tourist, jetsetter, or anyone that enjoys traveling in mind. We want the user to be able to share their travel experiences, and view the experiences of others who visit these cities as well. The app is intended to be interactive, allowing you to add posts about a particular city, making it a fun and customizable experience.

## Process
### The Good
We incorporated Agile development by dividing work among team members and keeping a frequent flow of communication to ensure we were all on the same page. We also used mob programming, which made tackling difficult concepts more efficient. We were successful in branching and merging our work through GitHub.

### The Bad
Nothing, our group is amazing! Managing our time was difficult - especially with a short time frame to complete this project. We didn't meet with the client enough to get feedback. We spent a lot of time on things that the client ended up not liking and we had to change and missed out on the bonus/reach goals. 

### The Ugly
Our code needs refactoring. 

## Thanks & Shout Outs

Bonus and reach goals such as user validation, tracking a user's individual posts and the ability to add comments to each individual post.
